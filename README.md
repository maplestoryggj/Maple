## About

The 2019 GGJ theme was *'What home means to you'* and we think that home is wherever you are. So we developed this game where you control the wind and have to save a desperate maple seed ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUEXKapAVcY) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ukk07JH4qI)) that does not want to leave the tree.
